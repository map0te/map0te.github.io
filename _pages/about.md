Hi, I am a first year Ph.D. computer science student at Georgia Tech. I work in Richard Vuduc's lab, the "HPC Garage", currently exploring memory access behavior for distributed graph algorithms on HPC clusters. My interests include HPC and Computer Architecture codesign, as well as a bit of formal methods (in particular SAT solvers).
